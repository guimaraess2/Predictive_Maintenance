PREDICTIVE MAINTENANCE WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

It is common to have failures in machinery and equipment systems, but predicting failures and taking preventive measures is possible using the great power of AI (Artificial Intelligence).
In this project, a Machine Learning model was implemented using Python language, on the Google Colab platform, using PowerBI to make the information available to the end user.
Within the context, statistical inferences were approached, such as the validation of hypotheses, estimating through samples, making it possible to extract significant insights for decision making according to business rules.
